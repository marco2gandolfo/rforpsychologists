A basic R course for psychologists

Here I attempt to put together few basic things that have been useful when I decided to switch to R for my data analysis.
This tutorial is mainly for psychologists but probably R beginners in other fields could benefit from it.

The menu dataset has been downloaded from joeystanley.com. Another website with many useful resources.
The bootdata2.csv dataset is randomly generated.
